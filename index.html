        <h1>‚ù§Ô∏è A letter to my love.... ‚ù§Ô∏è</h1>
        <p>Hey baby, I want to tell you a story of how much it means to me to have someone like you in my life. </p>
      <p> This story goes back to the day I first met you, in my "Kia Soul", The first time I laid my eyes on you, the first time you entered the car with a big smile </p>
      <p> I knew.... you'd be the one</p>
      <p>The first day with you I was hella nervous, I mean I had a REALLY pretty girl sitting right beside me and I couldn't wait to spend some quality time with her.</p>
      <p>quality time? I think I have never had such an outstanding company in my life. YOU being there with me really elevated the fun I had the whole day.</p>
      <p>Honestly, I was hella satisfied with how well our time went. but to my surprise, god had other plans </p>
      <p> I think I can never forget the last day of our trip, the feeling was just OUT. OF. THIS. WORLD. the time we spent on the roof of London House to the drive back home to the...</p>
     <p>Kiss, in the car on YOU</p>
      <p> That moment just made the first ever trip we had out of this world.</p>
      <p> I'll keep this website on for eternity and mark it on the map where I had the best kisses of my life with you</p>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/PNEzedN.jpg" width="300px">
        <p>Every Single day has been the best days of my life, </p>
      <p>From Buc-ee's sword fights (I know, that sounds so wrong üòÜ) and road trips to attending concerts together and driving you home when you're drunk‚Äîevery memory we've made is priceless. I truly can't forget a single moment with you.

Our first Texas trip showed me not just how amazing of a cook you are, but also what an incredible partner you could be. Every time I went to the office while you stayed home, I missed you so much‚ÄîI just wanted to rush back and hug you for hours.

I love trying new foods with you, discovering new places, and making them our go-to spots until I eventually get bored. I cherish your fresh perspective on life, and I enjoy every single moment of it with you. üíñ </p>
      <p>I want to be able to continue this adventure with you for the rest of my life (fingers crossed). I really see a good future for us. I'll tell you now and I'll tell you every single day - You motivate me, inspire me, cherish me, make me love you, and want to be loved by you. You an amazing gift to me. </p>  
      <p> Also, I'm aware that we disagree on some sensitive issues and of course, we have our fair share of conflicts. I want to assure you that no matter what, I'll be here for you. I'm not going anywhere. You make me feel things I only dreamt of. you make my life feel like a dream worth living the rest of my life</p>
     <p>A tribute to my love towards you, I want to add my most favorite pictures of you and together</p>
